# Overlapping Community Detection on Attributed Graphs via Neutrosophic C-means

This repository contains the implementation of our paper: **"Overlapping Community Detection on Attributed Graphs via Neutrosophic C-means"**

---

## Dataset

The datasets used in our experiments are not included in the repository due to GitHub's file size limitations.  
Please download the full dataset package from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/Yuhan-Jia/Code-for-DPCNCM/releases) section and place it in the same directory as the code.


## Usage

- For synthetic datasets, run `main_synthetic.m`.  
  The clustering results will be saved as `.csv` files automatically.  
  Then run `index_compute.ipynb` to compute ONMI and Omega indices.

- For real-world datasets, run `main_real.m`.
